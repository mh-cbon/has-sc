WinRM is somehow broken at that day.\r\n- install [winrm plugin](https://github.com/criteo/vagrant-winrm): `vagrant plugin install vagrant-winrm`\r\n- execute `npm run test-windows`\r\n- wait, a looooooonnnnggggg time. Windows images are very big....\r\n\r\n\r\n#### linux\r\nTo run the __linux__ tests on a fedora-like box,\r\n\r\n- download and install `vagrant`\r\n- execute `npm run test-not-windows`\r\n\r\nor just\r\n\r\n- download and install `mocha`\r\n- `mocha test/not-windows.js`\r\n\r\n## TODOS\r\n\r\n- add tests for win7\r\n- add tests for win8\r\n- add tests for win10\r\n- add tests for win2008 server\r\n- add tests for vista ?\r\n\r\nThe problem is mostly about finding / building vagrant boxes of those OS.\r\n\r\nIf you run some of those systems, i d be happy if you run the tests and communicate the results.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nA static build version of `wget` is included in this repository for testing purposes on windows.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are :\r\n\r\n- power shell is not a reliable tool to do so because it provides such thing only from version 3.0\r\n- windows does not provide alternative to power shell capabilities\r\n- i was lazy to write a statically built C component\r\n- it exists.\r\n",
